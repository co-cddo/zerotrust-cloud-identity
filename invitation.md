# Invitation to Cloud Providers

`Subject: Join us for a one-day hackathon to build a zero-trust identity federation demo`

**Hey there, cloud engineers!** ðŸ‘‹

We're excited to invite you to join us for a one-day hackathon at GDS on **__th May** at the **Whitechapel Building, London**. This isn't your typical vendor event â€“ it's a hands-on, collaborative coding day where your technical team will work alongside engineers from other cloud providers to build something genuinely valuable.

## What's the deal?
We're creating an open-source proof of capability demonstrating cross-cloud identity federation in a zero trust environment. No long-lived credentials or API keys. No multiple logins. Just elegant, secure, portable solutions.

## Who should come?
Your technologists and engineers who love solving complex problems. This isn't a sales opportunity â€“ it's a technical collaboration where your team will be implementing your platform's specific capabilities within our shared framework.

## Why participate?
1. Demonstrate your platform's interoperability capabilities
1. Contribute to code that may influence public sector cloud adoption
1. Collaborate on infrastructure-as-code solutions that solve real problems
1. Help create a reference implementation that showcases best practices
1. Be part of a unique cross-industry initiative that benefits everyone

This project will continue beyond the hack day with ongoing contributions, creating a valuable resource for public sector organisations and beyond. Since everything is open source, your work will help enable secure cloud federation for anyone who needs it.

We look forward to seeing your engineers roll up their sleeves and code with us!
